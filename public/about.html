<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a cancer survivor (3 times) who is on a journey to reclaim my health and pursue my dreams after having to take a lot of time off to recover and get my life together (still a work in progress).
<br />
<br />
What I'm doing right now:
<ul>
  <li>Pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Maryland Global Campus.</li>
 <li>Taking care of my family and experiencing as many joyous occasions with my family as I can.</li>
 </ul>


Passions:
I love cutting-edge tech and scientific advancements and enjoy learning as much as possible about anything I'm passionate about (including programming, mathematics, health, and artificial intelligence).</p>

<p>Here's an AI-generated quote, which I have grown fond of:

<br />
<p>
Silent minds awaken,<br />
Wisdom blooms in quiet hearts, <br />
Knowledge shapes our path<br />
